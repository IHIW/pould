Description: Computes the D', Wn, and conditional ALD measures pairs of genetic loci. Performs these LD calculations on phased HLA genotype data recorded using GL String format. Alternatively generates Expectation-Maximization estimated haplotypes from phased data, or performs LD calculations on EM estimated haplotypes. Perfoms sign tests comparing LD values for phased and unphased datasets, and generates heat-maps for each LD measure.
